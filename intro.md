I was a computer science major for my undergrad. I have taken many of the computer courses at new Paltz including web page design. I made a prediction algorithm for a dermatopathology lab in my internship. In my years studying computer science I wrote countless programs, my favorite ones are in machine code, I like how many small operations can do a big job.
Web programing is hard for me so it’s good that I am going to get a better understanding of it. I’m mainly taking this class because I’ve taken every masters course available for computer science. But as you know websites are huge in the computer field so no matter what I end up doing there is a good chance it will involve what I learn from this class.
